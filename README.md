# Agentic AI for Financial Modeling & Stock Market Analysis

This repository is a template for building an intelligent agent that
automates financial data ingestion, modeling and insight generation.  The
aim is to reduce the manual effort involved in analysing stock data and
producing actionable recommendations.

## Components

* **Data ingestion** – Retrieve historical price and fundamental data
  from your preferred source (e.g. yfinance, Alpha Vantage).
* **Preprocessing** – Normalize and clean data, handle missing values,
  and compute technical indicators.
* **Predictive modelling** – Implement time series models such as
  moving averages, ARIMA, LSTM or transformers to forecast future
  prices or trends.
* **Agentic layer** – Orchestrate analyses, generate narrative
  summaries and surface anomalies or trading signals.

## Usage

The included script, `analysis.py`, provides stub functions for each
pipeline step.  Run it with a stock symbol to see placeholder output:

```
python analysis.py --symbol AAPL
```

You will need to integrate actual data providers and models to make
this tool useful.
